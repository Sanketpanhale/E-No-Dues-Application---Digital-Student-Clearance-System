## 🧾 About the Project

🎓 Traditionally, this process is manual, requiring students to physically visit multiple departments, leading to inefficiencies and delays. This app enables students to digitally submit clearance requests to different departments and track approval statuses in real-time.
- 📚 Library
- 🏨 Hostel
- 💰 Accounts
- 🧪/🖥️ Labs
- 📋 Admin & T&P

✅ Once cleared, students can download a **No Dues Certificate** directly from the app.
